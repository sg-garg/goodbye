Dear Schmuck

Updateing this message, seeing if it writes to the txt file
ttention Dealers:
Due to increasing demand, Olympic Arms is no longer accepting new Dealers. If you do not have an active and current* account already on file with Olympic Arms, please refer to the notice below this titled "Attention". *Active and Current is defined as an FFL account that has a current (unexpired) FFL on file with Olympic Arms, - AND - that has made multiple/regular purchases over the last 24 months.

If you are a dealer and do not have an active account as defined above, you can still purchase Olympic Arms products through the established Olympic Arms Distribution Network of Dealer Distributors and Wholesalers. We apologize if this causes any inconvenience. A list of available participants in the Olympic Arms Distribution Network can be obtained from your Olympic Arms Sales Associate by CLICKING HERE, or by calling 800-228-3471.

Distributor or Volume Discounts:
If you are not already a current member of the Dealer Distributor program, or an authorized Olympic Arms Distributor or Wholesaler,  volume discounts are no longer available regardless of the number of like items purchased. More clearly, volume purchases are no longer receiving volume discounts unless you are already part of our Dealer Distributor or Wholesale Network currently in place.

On-line Catalog:
Our ordering side of our site is currently offline.  Please use the link on the right to download a copy of our catalog to browse products. We apologize for this inconvenience.

For the time being no web dealer accounts will be activated as we are unable to do so with the store offline.  All orders are still accepted over the phone at (800) 228-3471.

More details to come soon.
